# Memory Game

In this project I tested JavaScript code provided by Udacity with Jasmine.

## Preview

## How To Load

---> Clone the repository

---> Open index.html

## Instructions

---> Review the functionality of the application within your browser.

---> Explore the application's HTML (./index.html), CSS (./css/style.css) and JavaScript (./js/app.js) to gain an understanding of how it works.

---> Explore the Jasmine spec file in ./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js and review the Jasmine documentation.

---> Edit the allFeeds variable in ./js/app.js to make the provided test fail and see how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application.

---> Return the allFeeds variable to a passing state.

---> Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

---> Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

---> Write a new test suite named "The menu".

---> Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.

---> Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.

---> Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".

---> Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.

---> Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".

---> Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.

---> Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.

---> Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.

---> When complete - all of your tests should pass.
